Git notes
=========

Check out remote branch from a repo:

>git branch
* master

>git pull origin master
From https://github.com/plartoo/coding-interview-university
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up-to-date.

>git branch -f progress origin/progress
Branch progress set up to track remote branch progress from origin.

>git branch
* master
  progress

>git checkout progress
Switched to branch 'progress'
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/progress'.

Push changes in local branch to remote branch 
>> git push -u origin <remote_branch_name>

Delete remote branch
>git push origin --delete progress
To https://github.com/plartoo/coding-interview-university.git
 - [deleted]         progress
 
 
Sync the fork up to date
1. Add remote from original repo in your forked repo
>git remote add upstream https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university.git
>git fetch upstream
2. Update your fork from original repo to keep up with their changes:
>git pull upstream master
3. Check your git remote situation and it should be something like this:
C:\Users\lacheephyo\Desktop\coding-interview-university>git remote -v
jwasham https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university (fetch)
jwasham https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university (push)
origin  https://github.com/plartoo/coding-interview-university.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/plartoo/coding-interview-university.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university.git (push)
In the above, the 'origin' is the link to your forked repo. Make sure it's right. Then do #4 below.
4. Send the just downloaded updates to your git repo
> git push origin master

 
If things get too messy and we need to delete a local branch
(soft)
>git branch -d progress
 
(force)
>git branch -D progress
Deleted branch progress (was f5f5b31).
